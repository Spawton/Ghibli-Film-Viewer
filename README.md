NOTE: The public Studio Ghibli API that I'm using is current undergoing maintenance/ having some issues, hence why the results aren't being generated. I appreciate your patience as this issue gets fixed, as it is out my hands.

A lovely responsive web app to view Studio Ghibli movies using the Ghibli REST API. I'm sure you have seen Howl's moving castle, but there's so many more gems to choose from!

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ghibli API

This app uses the Ghibli REST API, arranging, and displaying the data in a simple, and elegant interface.

Just try to tell me those buttons aren't satisfying. I dare you.
